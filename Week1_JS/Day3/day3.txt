1. The map() method in JavaScript creates an array by calling a specific function on each element present in the parent array. It is a non-mutating method. Generally map() method is used to iterate over an array and calling function on every element of array.


2. Syntax: array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)

  function(currentValue, index, arr): It is required parameter and it runs on each element of array. It contains three        parameters which are listed below:
  currentValue: It is required parameter and it holds the value of current element.
  index: It is optional parameter and it holds the index of current element.
  arr: It is optional parameter and it holds the array.
  thisValue: It is optional parameter and used to hold the value of passed to the function.
  Return Value: It returns a new array and elements of arrays are result of callback function.

6. The arr.find() method in Javascript is used to get the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided condition. It checks all the elements of the array and whichever first element satisfies the condition is going to print. This function will not work function having the empty array elements, also does not change the original array.


  The arr.filter() method is used to create a new array from a given array consisting of only those elements from the given array which satisfy a condition set by the argument method. 
  
  The Array.findIndex() method is used to return the first index of the element in a given array that satisfies the provided testing function (passed in by user while calling). Otherwise, if no data is found then value of -1 is returned.It does not execute the method once it finds an element satisfying the testing method.It does not change the original array.
